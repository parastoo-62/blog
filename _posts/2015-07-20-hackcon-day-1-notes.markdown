## Empathy

Empathy leads to understanding and understanding leads to diversity.

## Narrative Crafting

This creates an experience for everyone at the event. Write up a narrative of how you want someone to experience the event. Keep this generic and in mind throughout the event.

## Messaging

Let the attendees know what is acceptable, this tells them how to behave and sets the tone for the event.

## Code of Conduct

Make very clear, try to have people agree to it before the event. Reiterate this at the beginning of the event.

## Food

Food is so important, ask for dietary restrictions. Label foods with possible allergens.

## Experience Crafting

Post speaker information when confirmed.

Men and women’s cuts. Make everyone feel included! It is frustrating when you can’t get a shirt That looks good on you or that you enjoy.

Stock lady products in bathrooms. Again, inclusion.

Look into having a unisex bathroom.

More than 2 gender options

Advertise events through groups that have missions that align with yours.

Ask attendees to clean up the space.

## Retrospective

Talk to volunteers, organizers, staff, etc. and talk about what went wrong, what went well, what could be improved on etc.

Ask attendees what they liked and didn’t like.

## Barrier Removal

Make it very explicit that this is a safe place. Mistakes are how learning happens. Open words of encouragement, let them know you believe in them.

**Icebreaker**: share one thing they have done and they are proud of. This breaks down barriers.

## You

Take care of yourself. Unless there is an immediate emergency, you can take a 15 minute break.

recruiting outside of normal demographic: worked with groups where their missions were aligned with the theme.

Stalk twitter to see what people are saying about the hackathon.

# LARPing Notes

We acted out different hard to deal with situations.

## Angry Parent of Minor

Make sure to check the check in list, that will tell you if the student ever showed up in the first place. Best thing to do is have a few people with the parent, walking the around and reassuring them their child will be found. Stay calm, and get information about the student while showing them you are working with the situation. Have people search for the student without coming off as worried or the parent will pick up on it. Reassure them that no one (especially under 18) can leave the premises, so the student will definitely be found.

## Drunk Sponsor

MLH Code of conduct, escalate this to MLH. Tell them being drunk is inappropriate, work with them to escort them to a hotel or something and offer to let them come back, unless they make a scene. If they start to threaten then just tell them they have to leave, talk to MLH. Try to stay calm, and move them to another room to talk privately about what is wrong and how to fix it.

## Inappropriate App Demoed

Try to mitigate this beforehand by announcing certain things are inappropriate and will not be considered for prizes. Walk around throughout the hackathon and check in with people about what they are working on (not only to quiz them, this also makes them feel like they are participating). Make sure all volunteers and mentors know what is inappropriate. Don’t make people feel like they are doing something completely wrong but let them know it makes some people uncomfortable and that is something you don’t want as this is a safe place.

## Sponsor Dressed Inappropriately

Offer to find them new clothing and offer to work with them. Don’t just kick them out, they want to be there and you want them there. Example of this is a "Booth Babe" where company sends a rep in a bikini or something. Refer to this as inappropriate and never as distracting.

## Reporter Asking Hard Questions about Diversity

Don’t make excuses, stay calm. Make sure to tell them you realize this is a problem and are working on it, give examples of what was done to help and what you intend to do in the future.

# Content Discussion

Talks, photos, video, etc. Used to promote, for sponsors, etc.

## 50 Days of BitCamp

Got students involved with planning (e.g. which t-shirt do you want), and it engaged students before the event started. Social media, 50 days of BitCamp where they announced one new things about the hackathon a day for 50 days.

## Blog Posts Are Good

Profiled community people, update on events, etc. Engagement measured by shares and stuff.

## Advertising

Partnering with other hackathons is useful for promotion.

Post pictures of people using the swag and stuff.

Content between hackathons is difficult. Don’t let it die once it is over. Share photos of the events afterward.

## "Hacker Clubs"

These are good. This would be a club version of the hackathon, or one to go alongside it. Something that kept people interested and got people ready throughout the year. Could be accomplished through talks, workshops, etc. One person created a club that had high schoolers teach middle schoolers. Flyers with people creating things and videos to get the kids motivated. Parents attended info sessions and it really helped getting kids motivated.

## Think about What Kind of Content You like to Consume

Look at what other hackathons do and think about what you like to see. Cool stuff that is going to happen is a good thing. Pride theme was good a few weeks ago. People seem to really like the 50 days of bitcamp thing.

## Facebook Ads

Target certain posts to certain audiences. Example of this is that some students are more interested in the logistics such as what APIs will be available, what the wifi speed will be, etc. While others are interested in things like school pride and learning new things. Try to post specifically to these groups instead of everyone at once.

## Focus on Your School First

Go to club meetings and classes and get the students, these are people who can definitely come and are the most important to you. School spirit is important. Go to first year classes specifically (cs, engineering, math, etc) and reach out to them.

## Workshops

Reach out to alumni who work at companies now and have them give workshops. This shows students where the field goes and that this leads somewhere.

## Local Hack Day

First time a lot of people get introduced to code. Beginner friendly attitude is important for this. Allow your value to show through with everything you post.

## Branding

Some hackathons have a standard logo that is used almost every year but is changed every once in a while. Is it best to have a consistent logo and change the theme or change it up every year? Stay consistent for the most part, but subtle changes are fine. Colors can change. Have a logo and a brand. Frame it so it is consistent but don’t overthink it.

## Metrics to Measure Engagement

Looking for conversions. Conversion are if they are going to give email and apply for event. Tools exist. Use Google Analytics. Content should be generating page views and conversions. Blog posts care about how many unique visitors, how long people were there, etc. Upworthy has something about what kind of content is helpful (Google: Upworthy content metrics). Ask people how they found out about you, did they find out from a blog post, a friend, a facebook page, etc. Survey people. Look at numbers.

## Drop Off Numbers

Events after signup closes to give people drop off spots (spots where people aren’t going to show up after they signed up). These get people excited and also close a gap with no-shows. A week before the hackathon some people send out an email to be like "hey let us know if you are actually coming." Some sign ups involve a question about why they want to attend, restricted to 100 words or something, to figure out who is coming to learn and not just to attend every hackathon they can get into. No one ever emails to say they can’t go, you have to reach out to them.

## Local Colleges

Market to these guys, so many people will want to go to hackathons from these places but get overshadowed by larger universities, or just don’t know about them.

# Sponsorship

## Slides

Mentioned they would be on his Github ([github.com/shrav](http://github.com/shrav){:target="_blank"}) and not to take notes (I took a few anyway).

## Messaging

What is in the email, date, time, pitch, why us and not another, what we need, what they want.

## Audience

Who are they emailing, what is their title what industry, where are they. Keep following up with them without seeming annoying.

# Corporate Sponsorship

## Contact

Vikram Rajagopalan ([@rajavick](https://twitter.com/rajavick){:target="_blank"})

[vikram.raja@gmail.com](mailto:vikram.raja@gmail.com)

## "Corporate"

Companies that aren’t really tech centered but they are huge. Big corporations are completely different from tech companies. Delta for example, as opposed to Google or Facebook.

## Make Your Initial Contact

Look for highest ranking alumni, look within IT. Only talk to VP or above.

## DON’T

* Reach out to college recruiting or human resources.

    * They don’t have decision power.

    * Driven by business demand.

* Say the word hackathon

    * At least in the beginning.

    * Call it an "innovation marathon"

    * Builds up a wall, they will be skeptical.

## What You Want from Them

If you want them to be selling product/brand, talk to marketing instead because they have more power in that area.

## Don’t Oversell Yourself

You want a long term relationship. It won’t transform them over 36 hours. It will open their eyes though.

## Attendees Care About What We Care About

If you care about money and prizes, that’s what they will care about as well. Make it your priority to care about the important things, like your mission or fostering a safe learning environment.

## The Coolest Venue

You don’t need a venue with a super cool basketball hoop or a pool. Hackers need WiFi and power, a space to work, a comfortable temperature, personal space.

## Premium Food

Don’t need amazing food. Worry about the food line not being too long, worry about dietary restrictions, worry about snacks so they aren’t starving between meals, worry about keeping students full and hopefully providing nutrition.

## Shirts

Don’t need them. Sponsors give shirts, everyone has a lot of shirts.

**Alternatives**: Personalized swag (notebooks, water bottles) things that are not t-shirts. MLH does laptop cases, hats, etc. Things like this are more unique and last longer.

## BIG Keynote Speaker

Hackathons are not conferences. Open ceremony is for sponsor demos (sometimes) and organizers to set the tone of the event (code of conduct, how to report things, where food and bathrooms are, etc). They don’t want to listen to a speaker forever if they came solely to work on a project.

## "Best" Hackers

Don’t even need "hackers". You want people who come to learn. Stop using words like “best”, it loses value. Everyone advertises that they have the “best” hackers, and it means nothing to anyone at that point.

## Non-Quantifiable Words

Don’t need the most epic, chill, etc. events. Want quality and more creative ways to talk about events.

## HUGE Events

Hackers prefer 100 - 600 person events the most. Listen to the students. You may want everyone in the world to come, but that doesn’t give the best experience. It distracts from things and makes planning harder. Size doesn’t mean anything to attendees if you aren’t doing it right.

## Random Attractions

Can be good, but if you aren’t doing it right then it doesn’t mean anything. If only 30 out of 200 attendees use the attraction, was it worth it? Focus on why they are there and find other ways to relax and step away from their projects.

## Travel Reimbursements

Big events need these, smaller don’t. Way too much time is spent on this. If you mess up any of this process people will never forget. Buses within 6 hours is fine, but don’t worry about across the country. You blow off too many people in the local community. Local communities don’t get to attend events because they get overshadowed.

## Fancy Awards Ceremony

Awards ceremonies are nap time. People want to leave, they are tired from staying up working. People don’t pay attention and they don’t go, a lot of people leave when award start. Make sure the transitions between sponsors and events are done efficiently. Show off the cool projects, not the best. Make sure winners know they won and that is it.

## Focus on What Matters

You have more resources when you don’t worry about some of this stuff.

### Learning

Leave with more knowledge than you came in with. Help all attendees learn and grow (not just beginners).

### Mentorship

Being stuck is isolating. Most attendees who had bad experiences had them because they got lost and didn’t know what to do and weren’t helped. Make sure mentorship is readily available and is supportive.

### Supportive Hacking Environment

Focus on this throughout the event. "inclusive" and “safe” are most of the time mutually exclusive. Instead of worrying about trivial things, focus on this.

## Core

Engineering job right out of school isn’t always the best thing to do.

Planning a Hackathon is a great thing to do for your future career and getting jobs.

We are teaching people to code and to learn, and there are jobs that do that rather than developing (Developer Evangelist).

# The Hacker Renaissance

## Contact

Dave Fontenot ([@davefontenot](https://twitter.com/davefontenot){:target="_blank"})

## Apprenticeships

Parallel today: Internships.

Master brings on apprentice and apprentice takes on master’s role.

## Patronage

Parallel today: Hackathons.

You get to do whatever you want with the patronage.

Hackathons let you work on whatever you want for the weekend.

## Printing Press

Parallel today: The Internet.

Unleashed so much knowledge into the world.

## Building a Movement

Renaissance was a movement, challenging the preconceived notions at the time.

Is there lasting value? Hackathons should last for years after the event.

## Plato’s Allegory of the Cave

This is less about teaching people how to code, and more of showing them they can do amazing things. More than just coding and tech. Show them that there are problems they can go and fix themselves. Wake them up, break them from their shackles and bring them out of the cave.

## Community

When you are trying to build a community, culture is everything. Culture is not something you can choose to create. It is defined by the people who attend the event. You can set precedence by seeing how people interact with you and they can bring that to others.

## Empathy

Most of the attendees haven’t attended before. Keep in mind how they feel. People will remember how you made them feel, not what the hackathon involved. Be in tune with how they feel.

## Questions

These are questions attendees have.

1. Am I welcome here?

    1. If door is locked, you won’t feel welcome.

    2. Imposter syndrome, they don’t know if they belong, if they are good enough.

2. Do I belong here?

    3. Will they have fun? Will they actually build something?

Answer these at the beginning, and make sure they know answer is yes.

## Answer These Questions

Greet people enthusiastically. People will feel welcome when you give a huge WELCOME to every single person. Shake their hands and make it one on one. Have people at the door and greet everyone. Greeters can say they don’t know what they will be working on either, let them know they aren’t the only ones who aren’t sure.

## Make Intros

Can’t just introduce yourself and then leave, they will feel lonely again. Optimal solution would be to greet people then introduce them to others.

## The Loop

Introduce people to each other who are worried. It will teach others to do the same. Show people that others are scared and they can help them. They will learn and do the same next time, and will introduce themselves and others to someone.

## Distribute Ownership

You can’t be the leader for EVERYTHING. When people come to you, direct them to others. That way you are teaching others to lead instead of being the only one. They will do it too. Part of the "loop" as you are teaching someone else to do what you do and they will do the same and teach others.

## Civil Unrest

Millions of college students will graduate and have no idea what to do afterwards.College is all about the grades, real life isnt. Nothing at the top of the "hill" they reach after school.

## The Future

It comes down to us.
