# WiFi Discussion Notes

* Distributing the load helps, but most people want to keep their hackathon together.
* University wide WiFi: it went alright, but not great.
* Boilermake: 500-600 hackers in one room. Really bad WiFi issues. WiFi is contracted through the school IT department. Had a contract, but they weren’t specific enough and IT didn’t test it.
* HackDFW: Unique in that they are not a university affiliated event, they had to build out their own internet service and pay for their own provider. Things didn’t work out; paid lots of money, didn’t work out. 600 people.
* San Mateo event system: 1.5gigabits but no wifi. $50,000 for wifi distribution for a weekend. Some venues have wifi vendors they tie to and they inflate the price.
* Code Day LA: problem where internet just kinda… died. Router died.
* Me: UCF, outta luck
* Bernie: Swamp Hacks. First event, 130 people, in one of the eng libraries, lots of people on the guest network, only students had good experience because they had credientials.
* VT Hacks: Have to set up your own WiFi, can’t use university. Some place set up internet, too much broadcast power and everything interfered. Second time they got permission to use a bit of university infrastructure, and it worked better.
* A lot of computers don’t have ethernet on them and will need an adapter, i.e. all newer MacBooks.
* A lot of hackathons have had to buy temporary wifi.
* Recovering from failure
    * Ethernet cable making station
    * Backup plan: Deployment of a bunch of switches to bigger lecture halls.
* Boiler make gave each AP a different name and put up a map so that people would only connect to their closest AP, which solves software problems with devices talking to the wrong network.
* People setting up their own APs causes a big issue
* The problem is usually not bandwidth, but there was one case where that happened (some company uploading a ton of videos during the event).
* Teaming up and having the IT department on site helps a lot.
    * Sponsors aren’t just money, they’re a commodity. A sponsorship could be your IT department wanting their logo on your shirts in exchange for WiFi troubleshooting during the event.
* It helps to force your computer to use 5ghz if it supports it. Rename your 5ghz network to a different than 2.4ghz because otherwise your computer will switch between the two and thats a problem. 5ghz only devices on 5ghz only will be pretty much no problem.
* It’s not much of an issue for idling WiFi devices
* You really should pretest your network:
* Get a bunch of people together in there and run speedtests, which will pwn the amount of bandwidth and spam up the spectrum
* Heavy users:
    * People who get there without plans and download Android Studio
    * YouTube tutorial windows
    * Netflix
* Wired infrastructure: Really really really have USB -> ethernet adapters
* Really really talk high up to the IT department and make sure it happens
* Somebody paid for instructure in the venue and left it in there, that can be useful in terms of bargaining
* By offering that, you’re offloading the responsibility to the university
* Be careful with contracts that want to lock your event to a venue over multiple years
* Maybe have a NAS room or share flash drives that allow people to download all the things they suddenly think they need (Android Studio, etc) so that it doesn’t stuff up the network. Maybe get a sponsorship to do that
* Hackers do get pissed when you want them to use the wifi lightly
* Hackathons will lose a lot of attendees when the wifi goes down because theyre like eh no point in being here
* It’s worth researching what the sweet spot of people is where you need to really worry about wifi coverage
* Again, definitely talk to IT and get advice from them
* Might be worthwhile to have a hackathon co-op where everyone pays in for different hardware and shares
