# Better Together: Working with Organizations

## Contact

Brynn Claypoole ([@bclaypoole](https://twitter.com/bclaypoole))

## Partner Organizations

NOT sponsors and NOT affiliated with your hackathon. Reach out to these organizations to plan cool and innovative things.

## Other Hackathon Organizers

Work with other hackathon organizers. Brynn went to other hackathons and saw they had a problem with long registration lines and tried to help debug and fix it. She helped them and learned a lot. They ended up having a lot of registration spots at the next PennApps which significantly cut down the lines.

## VT Hacks

PennApps and VT Hacks worked together to send organizers back and forth to each other’s hackathons. They helped VT Hacks out by allowing their organizers to help organize PennApps, giving VT Hacks organizers more experience running hackathons. It took some of the stress off of the PennApps organizers, and some stress off of VT Hacks organizers when PennApps organizers were helping them. Brynn helped judge at VT Hacks and it helped her learn to make the judging process better for PennApps. 

**Hackathon Exchange**: asking for other organizers to help run yours, join the Hackcon facebook group.

## Volunteering

Brynn showed an old volunteer schedule, there wasn’t much organization and only like one person actually showed up to volunteer, because there was no motivation for them to actually show up. Hackathon organizers ended up being super busy the whole time. They started to think about who to reach out to for volunteering next time.

### Possible Volunteers

* CS Students?

    * This is what was already happening, didn’t work.

* Engineering Groups?

    * Other engineers were not interested in the hackathon.

* Frats/Sororities (Service)?

    * Didn’t go with this.

* APO

    * They volunteer around the city every weekend, so she contacted them for help.

### Why APO?

* Scale

    * So many volunteers to help with so many things.

* Reliable

    * They have to actually show up, there was a requirement.

* New People

    * People outside of CS came and saw what this was about.

Brynn sent an email to the organization and made sure to explain what the event was, what volunteers were needed for, what they would provide to volunteers, etc.

## Health

Brynn has always really been into Biology so she wanted to somehow integrate it. She got an email from a chair of an entrepreneur group on campus. He wanted to get involved with PennApps and collaborate. PennApps Health came out of this, it was a sub-hackathon within it. The guy helped to get sponsors, medical students, and people working in hospitals to get involved and talk about what they do and problems. They had an award based off of health within PennApps.

## Sitchfest

**Video**: [StichFest Winter 2014](https://vimeo.com/100366066)

### What?

* Lilypad Arduinos

* Penn Design + Penn Education

Taught people who weren’t really into tech about what they could do with these arduinos. Was a collaboration of making clothes, stitching, and arduinos. Worked with people outside of PennApps to make something really cool.

## Nonprofits

Brynn helped throw a separate hackathon with nonprofits. The hackathon was just students building on problems the nonprofits had.

### Codelinc

* Boys & Girls Club

    * Build a system for money transactions.

* School Tools

    * Provides school supplies to schools that can’t provide it.

    * No way to maintain stock of what they had, wanted a system to keep track of it.

    * Maintenance was the biggest issue.

* Science Campus for Girls

Struggled to work with these groups to come up with something that students could build in a weekend, but ended up finding a happy medium.

## Waivers

Waivers weren’t really a thing when PennApps started. Hackathons are dangerous though. No sleep + stress + caffeine can cause a lot of problems. Rage quitting is a problem, can be dangerous. Laptops get stolen from time to time. Attractions are fun, but sometimes dangerous.

These kinds of things are big legal problems, and you can get sued even if you are a student group. Brynn worked with a lawyer in her family to write a waiver, had the school approve it, and now they use it. Waivers aren’t really sound either, it won’t cover you for everything.

## Engineering School

They have always worked with the engineering school. They aren’t a student group, they just meet at the school. PennApps work with the officials at the school and they provide PennApps with a lot of things like hardware and locations. Everything is a collaboration between several groups. The dean of engineering really likes them, and helps them out by appearing and providing resources.

## PHL

City of Philadelphia. Partner with the city, such as using the city’s open data to have people build things about traffic problems for example. They have had the mayor come and speak before. 

# How to Diff

## Contact

Jeff Hilnbrand ([@jhilmd](https://twitter.com/jhilmd))

## Productive Differentiation in Hackathons and Other Things

Very first stage of making something that is really different and creates that unique experience. Should hopefully apply outside of hackathons.

## Hackathons are Like Startups With a Timebomb

You build a team, fundraise, product-market fit, develop, market, design. This prepares you for building a startup basically, but it blows up after the weekend and is over.

Learn how startups and businesses work and bring it to your hackathon.

## Think Different

Think about when things will start to get harder and slow down, when will your hackathon need to become more innovative.

Think about how to differentiate and get out of the "bubble."

## Diff

Github is version control, it shows what has changed over time. With hackathons, we change a little bit of metadata but not the programmatic elements of the events. We should all be thinking about not just how we can fill the venue with enough people to make it happen, but why we are doing it and how we make it so that people can get something out of it they can’t get anywhere else.

## Innovation

The last innovation that happened in the hackathon scene is the expo.

## Techniques

### Embrace Constraints

In design, it is really fun to do this. Jeff challenged himself to represent his roommates in the most basic way. People talk about constraints being the key of innovation. Think about constraints and finding ways to solve problems. 

**Examples**

* Hackathon with no wifi?

    * Hardware.

    * Develop locally (localhost:2015)

        * Don’t rely on stack overflow, meet other people and solve problems with others.

    * Hackside 2015, at a park.

        * New environment pushes you to do something differently.

* No food?

    * Short.

    * Potluck!

        * Byte of college park, go to local restaurants and get a taste of them.

* No Laptops?

* No Venue?

    * This would encourage working to help homeless for example.

### Simplify

Being different doesn’t always mean more things, sometimes taking away is better. 

### Unique Positioning

We are all from different locations. Use your location.

### Invite Disagreement

If you are innovating, you are doing something others think won’t work. Your team members may disagree, your administrators. Invite this, it is trying something new. You are thinking discrete, not continuous. Think of something other people will say won’t work.

### Go Public

Announce something you will regret later? Be up front to the world. You want to do something radical others will disagree with and aren’t sure if you can go all the way, go public with it!

## Technica

All female event, has been done before. They wanted to focus on culture. What is the great way to stay engaged in tech if you are somewhere you aren’t familiar with? Culture. Learn more about tech culture than tech code. Translate culture by bringing along mentors and sponsors that are hacking alongside them. They will have the same name tags, will work on the same projects. They will be working with the students. Will share students.

[gotechnica.org](http://gotechnica.org/)

People disagree with them, they are inviting that and will learn from it. They’ll share what they learned.

## Your Diff?

Really think about what you are doing differently. Think about before marketing, branding, venue, etc. How can people learn that they can’t anywhere else.

# WiFi Discussion Notes

* Distributing the load helps, but most people want to keep their hackathon together.
* University wide WiFi: it went alright, but not great.
* Boilermake: 500-600 hackers in one room. Really bad WiFi issues. WiFi is contracted through the school IT department. Had a contract, but they weren’t specific enough and IT didn’t test it.
* HackDFW: Unique in that they are not a university affiliated event, they had to build out their own internet service and pay for their own provider. Things didn’t work out; paid lots of money, didn’t work out. 600 people.
* San Mateo event system: 1.5gigabits but no wifi. $50,000 for wifi distribution for a weekend. Some venues have wifi vendors they tie to and they inflate the price.
* Code Day LA: problem where internet just kinda… died. Router died.
* Me: UCF, outta luck
* Bernie: Swamp Hacks. First event, 130 people, in one of the eng libraries, lots of people on the guest network, only students had good experience because they had credientials.
* VT Hacks: Have to set up your own WiFi, can’t use university. Some place set up internet, too much broadcast power and everything interfered. Second time they got permission to use a bit of university infrastructure, and it worked better.
* A lot of computers don’t have ethernet on them and will need an adapter, i.e. all newer MacBooks.
* A lot of hackathons have had to buy temporary wifi.
* Recovering from failure
    * Ethernet cable making station
    * Backup plan: Deployment of a bunch of switches to bigger lecture halls.
* Boiler make gave each AP a different name and put up a map so that people would only connect to their closest AP, which solves software problems with devices talking to the wrong network.
* People setting up their own APs causes a big issue
* The problem is usually not bandwidth, but there was one case where that happened (some company uploading a ton of videos during the event).
* Teaming up and having the IT department on site helps a lot.
    * Sponsors aren’t just money, they’re a commodity. A sponsorship could be your IT department wanting their logo on your shirts in exchange for WiFi troubleshooting during the event.
* It helps to force your computer to use 5ghz if it supports it. Rename your 5ghz network to a different than 2.4ghz because otherwise your computer will switch between the two and thats a problem. 5ghz only devices on 5ghz only will be pretty much no problem.
* It’s not much of an issue for idling WiFi devices
* You really should pretest your network:
* Get a bunch of people together in there and run speedtests, which will pwn the amount of bandwidth and spam up the spectrum
* Heavy users:
    * People who get there without plans and download Android Studio
    * YouTube tutorial windows
    * Netflix
* Wired infrastructure: Really really really have USB -> ethernet adapters
* Really really talk high up to the IT department and make sure it happens
* Somebody paid for instructure in the venue and left it in there, that can be useful in terms of bargaining
* By offering that, you’re offloading the responsibility to the university
* Be careful with contracts that want to lock your event to a venue over multiple years
* Maybe have a NAS room or share flash drives that allow people to download all the things they suddenly think they need (Android Studio, etc) so that it doesn’t stuff up the network. Maybe get a sponsorship to do that
* Hackers do get pissed when you want them to use the wifi lightly
* Hackathons will lose a lot of attendees when the wifi goes down because theyre like eh no point in being here
* It’s worth researching what the sweet spot of people is where you need to really worry about wifi coverage
* Again, definitely talk to IT and get advice from them
* Might be worthwhile to have a hackathon co-op where everyone pays in for different hardware and shares

# Mentorship and Learning Discussion

## Testimonials

## Brown

Most were brown students, they got a lot of alumni at other companies and had them mentor. One mentor per team, people liked that. Used LinkedIn. Most were there the whole time. They were all sponsors/mentors. 

## Hack VCA

More beginners. Majority were people who didn’t know how to program. Don’t set a goal to learn how to code overnight. Their goal was to show them that they can make real projects. They left the event with a working project. They had a workshop at beginning to create a landing/portfolio page. They could then show their friends and want to learn more. 

Didn’t want highschool mentors, thought it might cause a problem to have people your age to be teaching you.

## Mentors at Hackathons

## Preparing Mentors

Questions to ask:

* What do they need to know?

* How to make sure they are successful mentors?

Give packets and tell them when the best times to talk are.

One group made a mentor guide they sent out beforehand. 

One group roped it in as a sponsor conversation. If you were going to bring people, make sure they bring enough engineers. Made sure sponsors understood the engineers would stay as long as possible. Encourage sponsors to bring engineers. Never limit how many engineers a company can bring.

## How to Keep Mentors?

Have a ticket system? And give them something for being active? 

One group says the more they talk to mentors to tell them how important it is for them to stay and be there, they will stay. They need to understand how important mentorship is for the event. They don’t realize how important it is so they leave.

Have mentors right next to the hackers, they will realize how important it is. They will be on the same level and will want to be there the entire time. 

Some groups have engineers that cycle out. There will be a schedule for them to follow. 

Make sure mentors know if they give a talk on their API they need to be there to answer questions on it.

## Incentives for mentors to stay?

More important to let it be known it is important. Incentivizing them may not work and it may not be a good idea. 

## Incentivize Mentors

Swag is less of an incentive, the idea of helping is more.

## Swag for Mentors: Who is Enough of a "Mentor" to get Swag?

## Mentors and sponsors are kinda hand in hand sometimes. Mentors sign up before event (on website). Tried to make sure people stayed on track as a mentor.

## How to Distinguish Mentors/Alumni Physically?

## One group used Colored bandanas. Wristbands are good. Duke does different color shirts for sponsors, mentors, volunteers, and hackers. Design had to work with all four colors. Idea: capes. 

## What to Tweak to Keep Mentors on Track?

## Digital sign up?

## Mentor Chill Rooms

They could play games or get more food or chill. Sponsors as well.

Mentors may be better chilling in the same room as the hackers though?

Mentors sometimes miss food, this would help.

## Mentor Appreciation

Make sure they aren’t burned out and are doing well. Make sure they are appreciated it. Send out thank you cards and update them after the fact.

## Travel Reimbursement for mentors who apply?

Could help to get better/more mentors.

## How to get the Mentors Involved

## Cortexes at large hackathons - MHacks

Used classrooms and lecture halls with themes (ios, webdev, etc). It would be hackers helping hackers in a very specific context. Known as cortexes.

You can also get engineers from companies to help with these specific things. 

Breaking people into smaller groups feels like a smaller more intimate group.

## Cortexes at smaller hackathons

Different areas rather than whole classrooms. Split up by mentors in a big open area and people who need less help could go into smaller rooms.

## Ticketing Systems for mentors

Open this up to hackers as well, so students can answer tickets and stuff. Incentivize basically. It works for people who want to hack part time and mentor half time.

## Beginners at Hackathons

Want first time hackers to feel comfortable learning something news and having resources.

## Guidelines for Beginners to Ask to Help

Have everyone just chat about their project and people will be interested in joining. 

## Tech Talks

## Beginner level tech talks.

## Beginner centric hackathon

First workshop was "hacker 101" they would talk about how important googling is and how teams will get help. Workshop was an hour and there were quite a few who attended.

## Resources Online

Send to mentors and students beforehand. Would be like, we made a flask boilerplate for you. Starting is the hardest part for most people. They wonder where to start, what to use, etc.

## How Experienced Programmers and Mentors work together with Beginners

## Long-Term

Everyone wants to come up with a solution, most of the time internal communal growth is the best. You can’t ignore that establishing a foundation at your school is probably the most long term solution.

## Adopt a beginner?

If you were a first time hacker you could put what you are interested in and you would get an email from someone who is interested in helping you. Incentivize matching people and to stick with it is good. Having a prize for having a beginner seems kind of weird.

## Hackers Helping other Hackers

One guy says he likes the team building exercises and stuff. Mentors would help with that. Discourage teams of only advanced people and try to split them up.

Having a public page where people could post problems to. 

Internal Stack overflow.

## Part time mentor

Could sign up as mentor and hacker. People usually want to work on their thing more than mentor though. Offer swag as an incentive, but they would take the swag and go back to hacking. The best mentors aren’t worried about incentives though, they just want to help. 

## Experienced teams who aren’t actively looking but could take one?

Tool for managing teams. They could form teams on this. People could see there are open spots and chat and join. Say you are looking for people with a specific toolset for example. 

This has benefit for before during and after. You can see what people were working on and what they are working on etc.

## Mentors the Same Age as Students?

Hard for mentors that age because they aren’t super knowledgable. 

## Online Mentors?

Light skill? It is better than nothing, a good supplement. Doesn’t replace real life mentors.

One group tried it because they had no mentors. It sorta worked, was hacky. Posted in HHSouth. 

## Matching with Mentors

Beginners are unlikely to go to mentors. 

One group had numbered tables and they had an app to enter table number and question. Mentors would come to help. People used it all day. There was a moderator who would assume.

Number tables and have mentors be responsible for certain tables. Mentors would check in on tables and ask if they need any help.

One group assigned mentors to projects. The mentors would be with one project and would choose it.

## Hackathon mentor exchange

an idea to come mentor for a hackathon.

## Potential issues

## Imposter Syndrome

Want to make sure this is squelched for students and mentors.

## Beginners don't know what to do

Mentors can help with this, help them figure out what they want to do and what the audience should be and blahblah. Possibly a booth of mentors where people can have like idea consultations.

## Dealing with Bad Mentors

Mean mentors for example. If they are really bad you should probably ask them to leave depending on how severe it is. It shouldn’t be a big problem, they should still be able to figure out a way to help. Most people want to come to events to help and stuff. 

# Passing the Torch Discussion

Biggest killer of every student lead thing ever.

## What do people do in terms of organization size

How big is the organization and where do people normally fit in? One person’s general thing is to try to bring in someone brand new into the event each time.

## MHacks

All the directors are usually rising sophomores or juniors. Once they step down, they will still be around for the next few years to mentor. Their general team is around 40 people, directors manage them, then there are advisors. To get onto the team, you have deliverables for each position (directors know what they want). Application process for directors. Example of deliverable: Make a map of the expo, get contact info for caterers. 

## Playbook

20-30 page playbook that is passed down and updated. Allows newer members to build on the mistakes of the previous members. Brain dump everything. People using it will ask questions and it will be updated. How do they take payment, where does eventbrite payment go, etc.

## Recruiting New Members

When you don’t have a demand for people on the team, how do you recruit them to be interested? Ask professors for referrals. Possibly host events and see who stands out at those events. One person breaks up what the different parts of a hackathon are, and market them to the people who might be interested. Doesn’t have to just be CS students. Another person told each director of an area to find a freshman or sophomore and recruit them to the team. They would mentor them and expand the group to more than just friends. Talking to TAs is another idea, they know a lot of freshman and sophomores. They can single out people who might be interested. Most of the time people won’t come to you to help, you need to search them out. Market the individual jobs, like sponsorship allows you to learn how to market and you talk to a lot of the big tech companies around the country. Tell them what they would be doing is impacting x number of students in a huge ways. Use social media marketing and stuff. Day of volunteer positions are a good way to get people to volunteer and you can then talk to them afterwards because they will want to help plan more. 

## Big Team vs Small Team

A bigger team isn’t necessarily a better team. Stories about having too many people doing one thing can cause more time managing and less time doing the actual task. 

## Inactive Members

Talk to them about it. IF they aren’t being helpful, they won’t be able to pass on their torch either. You will have to mentor newer ones as they will be a bit inactive until they figure out what they need to do. Make regular checkins and such. 

## How to Handle Summer Planning

Have often meetings, give busier people less to do, use Slack. People want to feel important. If you give someone a project or a task and make it very important, let them know they are the best at this and they need to do it. They will feel extremely important and will be motivated. They will also be motivated if you publicly announce something will be done. For instance, having a site where there are no sponsors will motivate sponsor people to contact them and web designer to update the site. On the other side, people who step up themselves to something are more likely to go through with it. It all has to be genuine.

## Micromanagement

Ownership for the other person with expectations from you is the best way to manage this. Let them know you are always there, but they are in charge and this is their thing.

"Go do this and that" vs “you are in charge of this, here is how you start.”

Let them own it but help drive it. Understanding scope is another thing that really helps. As the manager, your job is to be there when people need help, not to do their job for them. Forward questions to the person whose job it is, it shows them that other people are relying on them and they need to do things. Director should not micromanage everything, it will wear you out and will stress out the group. Director should stay calm if something is going wrong.

## Faculty Champions

Have a faculty person who is really excited about it. This person can help select new people when the old group is gone. Newer professors have less on their plates, good to ask. Some professors happen naturally, they are the ones who everyone loves and helps students with plenty of things. Invite professors and faculty to the event to see what is happening and that might excite them.

## Administration

Get upset that new companies come in and get the good students but don’t give back to the university. Sponsorship dinner and invite faculty to, have them think of research projects the companies could help with. 

## Don’t Drop off the Face of the Planet

Don’t drop off the face of the planet when it is over. Leave notes behind, don’t leave loose ends. It will make it easier to pass the torch and for the next event to happen. Be there for your team.

# Building Hacker Communities Outside of Hackathons

## Contact

Rodney Folz ([@rodneyfolz](https://twitter.com/rodneyfolz))

## Premise

People will work on things after hackathons, they don’t lose interest. For a lot of people this happens organically, but you can make it happen intentionally.

## RSO

Good to have a club on campus that focuses on building things. They ran themselves like a startup. 

## JUST DO IT.

Teach a workshop, invite speakers over. People want to come to learn and do cool things.

Find something people are interested in, find a place to hold it, and when target community is free, bring food, and advertise your event.

## The Five E’s of Good Speakers

Make sure your speaker is

* Experiences

* Exciting

* Engaging

* Knowledgeable

* Entertaining

Don’t hold info sessions, ice cream socials, etc. Hold events that people want to come to, not info sessions for a company. Try new things all the time.

## Established Brand

If you have an established brand, you can get anyone. If you aren’t a household name, hustle for it. Their first events were git workshop, html/css workshop, and something else I missed. It isn’t about the glamour of the events, people come because it is a cool new thing. 

## Don’t do it alone

Find some friends and do it together. Find freshmen to help you out. They were always doing things because they had so many leaders. People would come and wouldn’t want to miss something so they’d come to all.

## Hold a lot of different events

It takes one student who knows the material to hold an event. Hold lots of different ones to reach out to multiple people. 

## Avoid bureaucracy

Do what you have to do that the school requires you, but try to hack around it so you don’t waste time worrying about dumb stuff. Load balance around teams and not people. A workshops team for example. Have a person in charge of a single event and trickle responsibility down. "Everything lives or dies together." Work as a team.

## Media Matters

Don’t worry about oversaturating people from posting too much. So many studies show that if nothing else, frequency alone is enough to get people thinking more positively of you. If you are always there in the back of your minds, they will always think of you and will think positively of you. Head on was an example. Make friends with designers to make cool banners, advertisements, etc. Invite people to your events.

## Do things that don’t scale

Stripe started up by going to people and spending 30 minutes showing them how to setup and use it. They can’t do that now, as it would take forever, but it worked and caused them to grow massively. You have to do things that don’t scale. You can’t just create a website, student group, mailing list, and expect people to show up. You have to go out and meet people and introduce them to what you do. You have to learn what they are passionate about, tell other people about what they are doing. Make them feel part of your community, others will want to do cool things too. Other people will go out and bring people in too, but you have to start it.
